In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and I did a comparison between the temperature trends where I live to the overall global temperature trends. My goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this I performed a data analysis process which involves several steps that are explained in the project report.
